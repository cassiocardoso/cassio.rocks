    <h2 class="article__h2">~whoami</h2>
    <p>My name is Cassio, I'm a brazilian front-end engineer.
      I was born and raised in Taubaté, a small city in the country-side of São Paulo state,
      where I lived until 2014 before moving to São Paulo city.</p>
    <p>I did a technical course during the high school. That was the time I decided I wanted to
      work with web development. I thought server and network classes were boring, while I truly
      enjoyed the development classes, even though they were in Pascal, Visual Basic and
      Delphi.</p>
    <p>I had some doubts on what I was going to study on college but decided to do computer
      engineering over computer science, design and a few other stuff. I studied at UNIVAP in
      São José dos Campos and graduated in december of 2014.</p>
    <p>In July of 2014 I joined <a href="https://amaro.com">AMARO</a>, a fast-fashion brand
      located in São Paulo to work as a front-end developer. The company already had an
      ecommerce but was shifting from a third-party solution to an in-house one and I was
      responsible to redesign and develop the responsive front-end application following a
      mobile-first approach.</p>
    <p>We benchmarked great companies during the process and strived to build a site that
      felt like an app for the users. It was a tough and difficult process with a small team
      (one back-end developer and one front-end developer) but, after 7 months of hard work,
      we launhed the new ecommerce platform.</p>
    <p>Since mid-2016 I've been working as the front-end team leader. We're hiring new
      developers to join our team, as we start to work with a new tech stack based
      on ReactJS to develop new features to integrate in the current platform. I'm also
      in charge of defining a product roadmap for new features, plan our team sprints and
      dealing with stakeholders to define priorities.</p>

    <h2 class="article__h2">How I started</h2>
    <p>My first professional experience as a programmer came in a small development company
      where I spent 6 months as an intern. We used Visual Basic to build store management
      systems. It was a cool experience and a good starting point.</p>
    <p>After that I started working at INPE as a web developer in the brazilian Space Weather
      program. I spent 5 years working there, I started as a generalist web developer using
      PHP and MySQL to receive and store data from equipments. In the last couple years I
      focused on front-end development where we built some workshop hotsites and launched a
      redesign to the website.</p>

    <h2 class="article__h2">What I'm studying right now</h2>
    <p>We're starting a big project at AMARO to update our tech stack to use ReactJS, Sass,
      Webpack and other cool stuff so I've been studying lots of new JavaScript based stuff,
      such as: Flux, Redux, Immutable, TDD libraries, etc...</p>
    <p>I decided to do a redesign at my personal site to test some new tools as Hexo, Ejs and
      Stylus. I've been a Jekyll fan for a long time but so far so good with the new setup.</p>

    <h2 class="article__h2">Projects I'm proud of</h2>
    <p>I don't have a ton of open-source projects to show here. Some stuff I'm proud of doing
      aren't available anymore or has limited access. Despite that, there are some cool stuff
      to show here:</p>
    <h3 class="article__h3">SB Winners</h3>
    <p>That was a cool small project to learn the concept of AngularJS. The idea here was to
      consume a JSON file with a list of some of the latest Super Bowl winners and show the info
      on the screen, with the possibility to change the selected year. It's available at GitHub:
      <a href="https://github.com/cassiocardoso/sb-winners">SB Winners project</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="article__h3">Guia do Trabalho Remoto</h3>
    <p>Some time ago I was reading some articles on remote working when I got into a very cool
      site called <a href="http://guiadotrabalhoremoto.com.br/">Guia do Trabalho Remoto</a>.
      They had some really useful information so I really enjoyed the site. But when I tried
      to access from my celphone, it wasn't optimized, so I took some free hours during a
      weekend to help optimize it for mobile devices.</p>
    <h3 class="article__h3">Paint with Kinect</h3>
    <p>This was my graduation project at college. We used Microsoft Kinect to build an
      interactive paint application where the users could use their hand movements to paint
      on a white board. We also had some nice features like brush sizes and colors and
      an eraser. It's available at GitHub:
        <a href="https://github.com/cassiocardoso/paint-with-kinect">Paint with Kinect</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="article__h2">My preferred setup</h2>
    <p>At home I have a Macbook Pro late 2011 with no changes (i5, 4GB RAM, 500GB HD).
      Recently I upgraded the OS to the last version: "El Capitan" and it's running smoothly,
      which impressed me.</p>
    <p>For terminal I really like <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">Iterm 2</a> running
      <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>.
      I tried HyperTerm for a while but it seems a bit buggy for now, I intend to give it
      another try in the future.</p>
    <p>My text editor of choice is Atom, by far nowadays. After years using Sublime Text 2, i
      changed to Atom on 2014 and never looked back. I use several plugins, but one of the best
      is <a href="https://github.com/atom-community/sync-settings">sync-settings</a>
      which auto-save my settings in a Gist so it's very easy.</p>
    <p>Spotify is also a must.</p>
    <p>At work I run Ubuntu 15.10. And that's the only difference because I try to use the same
      softwares.</p>
